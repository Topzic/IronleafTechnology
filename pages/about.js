            <h3>Ian Cunningham</h3>
            <p>Veteran, Software Engineer, Entrepreneur</p>
            <p>I am an Canadian Armed Forces veteran and software engineering professional with over a decade of experience in technology and military service. As a former infantry specialist, I honed skills in discipline, teamwork, and mission-critical operations during platoon leadership and joint-force exercises. My Honors Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering Technology, combined with hands-on roles in IT support and project management at Ontario Parks, drives my commitment to sustainable, reliable tech solutions. A passionate outdoor enthusiast who loves hiking and running in Peterborough's natural surroundings, I am dedicated to empowering local businesses and organizations with technology that fosters growth, efficiency, and community impact. I am committed to helping fellow Canadians achieve their business goals with information technologyâ€”learn more about <a href="/services">my services</a>.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, trail running, and exploring the beautiful natural landscapes around Peterborough. I am passionate about sustainability and environmental conservation, which aligns with my professional values of integrity and service.</p>
