Use Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions to enforce security standards and remotely wipe devices if lost or stolen.</p>\n\n        <h3>Data Encryption</h3>\n        <p>Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Use tools like BitLocker for disk encryption and HTTPS for web communications.</p>\n\n        <h3>Regular Security Training</h3>\n        <p>Conduct ongoing security awareness training for all team members.
